# Prodigy InfoTech Internship Task 3 : Decision Tree Classifier

Welcome to my Prodigy InfoTech Internship repository! This repository documents are for Task 3 of my internship journey, focusing on building a decision tree classifier for predicting whether a customer will purchase a product or service, based on their demographic and behavioral data. It focuses on analysis and uncovering various patterns. 

## Task Overview

To build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Knowledge Gained

This task helped me a lot by enriching my expertise in building decision tree classifiers for predictive modeling tasks and understanding how demographic and behavioral data influence the customer purchasing decisions.
